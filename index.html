  <h1> Jeffersons Rough Draft of the Declaration of Independence</h1>
  <h2> Finding the sources that he used</h2>

  <p> A prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a people who mean to be free. Future ages will scarcely believe that the hardiness of one man adventured, within the short compass of twelve years only, to lay a foundation so broad & so undisguised for tyranny over a people fostered & fixed in principles of freedom.
